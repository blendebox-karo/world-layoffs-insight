The SQL data cleaning project involves processing and cleaning raw data using SQL queries and stored procedures. By utilizing a combination of data cleansing techniques and SQL functions, I transformed this complex and messy data set into clean, organized, and structured data that can be easily analyzed and visualized. The project showcases my skills in SQL and data cleaning, as well as my ability to work with large datasets to extract valuable insights.

The data cleaning process was achieved using the following proceedures as stated below:

-- Removing Duplicates

-- Removing blank and minimizing nulls

-- Standardizing the data

-- Removing any unnecessary columns
